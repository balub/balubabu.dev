## What am I up to this month

- Got into [the residency](https://www.residencyblr.com) to rebuild how on-call works at [Vader](https://usevader.dev/).

- [Krishna Shamiji](https://x.com/KrishnaShamji) is crushing content for BrainDump; I need to pick up the pace and finish the engineering quickly.
- I launched a beta of my one-click online 3D printing-on-demand service [autofab](https://autofab.app/) and test drove it at [Hardware Hackathon 2.0](https://hack.pcbcupid.com/) by [PCB Cupid](https://www.pcbcupid.com/). The platform crashed mid-hack, so I debugged and fixed it while traveling (fun). I found issues in a few implementations and I'm fixing them now so they're resolved in the final build.

# 2025

![Year of Realizations](/images/2025-realizations.jpeg)

2025 was a year of realizations for me. I'll write about them soon, but spoiler: one of them is about how on-call should feel, and I want to write more about it.

- Went back to Malaysia for the second time with friends for a well-needed break.
- I bought land!!!
- Partnering with [Krishna Shamiji](https://x.com/KrishnaShamji) to build BrainDump, a fresh take on note-taking that keeps ideas fast, searchable, and shareable.
- Designing a decentralized, one-click online 3D printing-on-demand service that I plan to launch alongside local maker collaborators.
- Redefining how on-call should feel with my company, [Vader](https://usevader.dev/).
- Our team at Absurd worked really hard getting everything ready for our booth at IndiaFOSS.
- My annual pilgrimage to [IndiaFOSS 2025](https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2025), cracked a lot of jokes at the [Open Hardware Devroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtF-I0-wJGo&t=10312s) there and gave a talk on [CoryDora: A Macropad, A Supply Chain, and A Case for Local Manufacturing](https://youtu.be/FtF-I0-wJGo) too. I also moderated the Birds of a Feather session on [Revitalizing the Bengaluru FOSS United Community](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/propose-birds-of-a-feather-bof-sessions-at-indiafoss-2025/5647/22).
- Attended the [Maintainer Summit 2025](https://fossunited.org/c/indiafoss/maintainer-summit-2025) on 19th Sept; it was fun, you can read more about it (here)[].
